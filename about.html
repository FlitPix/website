            <h1>Hiya, I'm Flit!</h1>

            <p>I'm a 22-year-old college senior, aiming for a bachelor's degree in Computer Technology... even though I've recently realized that programming is my passion. Some who've met me online over the years might also know me as Malik.</p>

            <p>I LOVE PokÃ©mon, perhaps a bit too much. I have been playing the main series games since around Generation III. The first main series games I've bought for myself was Black 2, and I haven't missed a game since. I also hold a decent soft spot for the PokÃ©mon Mystery Dungeon games and the stories that are told in them; my first PMD game was Gates to Infinity, and it's been a wild writing ride since then. My favorite PokÃ©mon is Vulpix!</p>

            <p>My online journey didn't truly start until high school in 2018-ish, when I joined a roleplay community on Google Plus of all things called Island of the Lost. I didn't realize how such a random decision would change my life at the time, but alas, I would soon become a part of the moderation team, and eventually become the owner of the community until early 2022, when the community seemed to rear its ugly head. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the place in good faith anymore, but it has directed me to places I cannot have imagined myself going before.</p>

            <p>I've realized that programming is what I want to do in life! I know the ins and outs of HTML and CSS, and I am currently in the process of learning Java and other languages.</p>
